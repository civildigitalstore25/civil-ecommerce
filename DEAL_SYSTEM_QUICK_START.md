## Tips for Success

### ✅ Best Practices
- Set deal prices **lower** than regular prices (customers expect savings!)
- Use whole hours for start/end times (e.g., 00:00, 23:59) for clarity
- Give deals enough time (minimum 24 hours recommended)
- Test with a short duration first to see how it works
- Monitor the countdown timer to ensure correct timing

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't set end date before start date (validation will catch this)
- Don't set deal prices higher than regular prices (defeats the purpose)
- Don't rely on manual updates - system is automatic!
- Don't forget to fill in all pricing fields you want to discount

### 💡 Pro Tips
- **Weekend Sales**: Friday 00:00 to Sunday 23:59
- **Flash Sales**: Short 6-12 hour deals create urgency
- **Holiday Deals**: Start a few days before, end day after holiday
- **Seasonal Sales**: Month-long deals for clearance
- Combine deal with "Best Seller" badge for maximum impact
